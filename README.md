Project Description: Analyzing restaurant data to gain insights into factors influencing aggregate ratings.

Level – 1 – Tasks: Data Exploration and Preparation

Task – 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Explore the dataset, identify the number of rows and columns.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.

Task – 2: Descriptive Analysis
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

Task – 3: Geospatial Analysis
- Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.

Level – 2 – Tasks: Feature Analysis and Insights

Task – 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

Task – 2: Price Range Analysis
- Analyze the distribution of restaurant ratings based on different price ranges.
- Explore the relationship between price range and other features like cuisine and location.

Task – 3: Feature Engineering
- Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Level – 3 – Tasks: Predictive Modeling

Task – 1: Predictive Modeling Setup
- Select appropriate features and target variable for modeling.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Experiment with different algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.


Task – 2: Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyze customer preferences based on the model predictions.
- Identify key factors influencing high or low ratings.

Task – 3: Data Visualization
Visualize model predictions and compare them with actual ratings.
Create insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
